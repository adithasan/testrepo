/*
Automated Content Moderation:
Auto-Negative-Note-Scan:    The server will need to scan the note’s contents to compare 
                            and decide whether it is appropriate enough to store and 
                            display to other users

Auto-Negative-Note-Inform:  The server should inform the client if the content was deemed 
                            inappropriate

Auto-Negative-Note-Show:    The client should inform the user that their note was not uploaded 
                            due to the note’s content containing inappropriate content
